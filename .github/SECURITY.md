# Security Policy

If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, we would like to know so we can fix it. This notice provides details for how you can let us know about vulnerabilities

## Supported Versions

Only last major version is currently being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a (suspected) security vulnerability in package code use the **Vulnerability Template** in the issues section.

If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. Use the **Vulnerability Template** if a dependency version update is needed to resolve the vulnerability.

When you are investigating and reporting the vulnerability, you must not:

* break the law
* access unnecessary or excessive amounts of data
* modify third-party data
* use high-intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities
* try a denial of service - for example overwhelming a real service with a high volume of requests
* disrupt production services or systems
* tell other people about the vulnerability you have found until we have disclosed it
* social engineer, phish or physically attack any staff or infrastructure
* demand money to disclose a vulnerability

## Bug bounty
Unfortunately, we doesn't offer a paid bug bounty programme.
